Welcome to the 47th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

_Building Placement in Digital Extinction_

[Digital Extinction] ([GitHub][de-github], [Discord][de-discord],
[Reddit][de-reddit]) by [@Indy2222] is a 3D real-time strategy game made with
[Bevy].

The most notable updates are:

- nightly versions are automatically built and published on
  [de-game.org][de-web] and elsewhere,
- significant progress has been made on multiplayer and networking,
- animated arrows on terrain are displayed for selected factories, indicating
  the path from the units' spawn points to their delivery locations,
- semi-transparent square markers are drawn on the terrain around selected
  buildings,
- health bars are briefly displayed above units and buildings when they take
  damage or their health changes,
- the implementation and design of the “Energy” have started to take shape,
- the head-up display (HUD) shows the total battery charge and the number of
  selected units and buildings,
- the main theme song plays in a loop, volume of the music can be configured,
- the aspect ratio of the minimap matches that of the game map,
- the option to invert camera zooming has been added to the configuration,
- the [documentation][de-docs] has been converted to mdBook.

See [gameplay][de-video] screen recordings on YouTube.
